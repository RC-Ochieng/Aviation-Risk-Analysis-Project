# Aviation-Risk-Analysis-Project
The purpose of this project is to identify which aircraft models present the lowest risks based on historical data.
It involves using an Aviation data set(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) to analyze patterns and recommend the safest aircraft to purchase.
This project includes a jupyter notebook file, the csv file used for this analysis downloaded from the above link and a presentation.
